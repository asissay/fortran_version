A FORTRAN file that can solve the time dependent Schrodinger equation
(TDSE) using restricted time dependent Hartree Fock approach
(TDHF). This test code has time propagated in imaginary time to check
to see if it works for actual RT-TDDFT calculations involving large
systems. Some of the matrices are generated from NWchem calculation.
